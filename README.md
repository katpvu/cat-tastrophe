# Cat-astrophe

## Background

A cat is very bored and wants to play with her owner. She knocks on the door aggressively. Each knock (up key) on the door increases your score by 59 points. Coming from the left and right of the screen are play mice coming to attack her. She must smash those mice, using the left and right keys, before it touches her. If it does touch her, she loses one of her 9 lives. If she misses the attack and smashes nothing, she will freeze for 1 - 1.5 seconds before being able to knock/smash again. There will be random critical moments (lasts 5 seconds) where the cat evolves into a big cat, in which every knock on the door is stronger thus increased to 250-400 points per knock. Once the critical moment has elapsed, she will transform back into a normal house cat and each knock is 100 points. However, the game gets more difficult over time because the number of mice will increase and there are 4 different colored mice traveling at different speeds. The game is over when all of her lives are lost.
